Project Idea:

Our idea is to create an interpreter for the fun language in Scala. We want to expand the capability of the fun language to support the following:

Existing functionality:
	-Assignment
	-Identifiers
	-If-else statements
	-While statements
	-Print statements
	-Support for addition and multiplication
	-Support for functions (including recursive functions and functions that redefine themselves)
	-New Proposed Functionality:
	-Support for division and subtraction
	-Support for for-loops
	-If we have time, include support for immutable Strings

By doing this, we hope to learn a new language and apply the skill we have developed in writing interpreters in a new and more challenging way.
We also hope gain experience with functional programming through this project.
